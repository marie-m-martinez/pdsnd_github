### Date created
Project was created in July 2022.

### Project Title
Project Title: GitHub repository for bikeshare project.

### Description
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in 
the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the 
terminal to present these statistics.


### Software used
Python 3
NumPy and pandas
A terminal application


### Files used
To address the questions that need to be answered using Python, you will need to write a Python script. The three files will be used: (1)chicago.csv, (2)new_york_city.csv, & (3)washington.csv.


### The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station
User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year


### Credits
In this project, a dataset was provided by Udacity which captured data from a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States to uncover bike share usage trends.
